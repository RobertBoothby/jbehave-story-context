    This package contains unit tests for the StoryContext related StoryReporters. At the moment the only test that can
    be written is against the Builder. Unfortunately the actual Output classes are effectively not unit testable because of
    an unfortunate lack of dependency injection combined with the use of private fields in the ancestral classes.
